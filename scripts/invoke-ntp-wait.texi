@code{ntp-wait}
will send at most
.Ar
num-tries
queries to
@code{ntpd(8)},
sleeping for
.Ar
secs-between-tries
after each status return that says
@code{ntpd(8)}
has not yet produced a synchronized and stable system clock.

@code{ntp-wait}
will do this quietly, unless the
@code{-v} flag is provided.
