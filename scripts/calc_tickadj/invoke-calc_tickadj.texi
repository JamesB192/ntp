The @code{calc_tickadj} script uses provided ntp drift file to generate optimal
tick value. Generally, ntpd can do better job if the drift value is the
smallest possible number. 

The example output of 
@example
$ ./calc_tickadj
81.699 (drift)
9999 usec; 9999779 nsec
$ cat /etc/ntp/drift
-23.159
@end example

means the following. If tick on that box is 10,000, by making the value 9999
we'll shift the box from its current drift of -23.159 to a drift of 81.699, and
in doing so we'll speed the clock up a little every second instead of slowing
the clock down a little.

If 'tick' on that box is 10,000,000 then by setting it to 9999779 the drift
value will be somewhere around 0.0.

@code{calc_tickadj} tries to determine the the tick value by using
@code{tickadj} program from ntp package. If this doesn't work you can specify
current tick manually on command line.
