# DESCRIPTION
#
# Generate an authors.txt file.  If the generated file is different
# from any existing copy, install it.
# Call with the path to the Authors/ subdirectory.
# - Why?  We know where it has to live...
# We might want either the path to checkAuthors or insist that
# checkAuthors is in the PATH (which is kinda horrible).
# Remember that genAuthors and checkAuthors are generated scripts
# that are not installed, so they're in the build tree.
