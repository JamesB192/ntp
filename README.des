If you want DES support in ntp:

- convert your DES keys to MD5 by changing the 'A', 'N' or 'S' to 'M'
- visualize whirled peas

If you *need* DES support:

- first see if you can simply "want" DES support instead
- Get RSAREF or RSAEURO (or a reasonable facsimile thereof)
- - Unpack it in the top-level source directory of the NTP distribution
    (You should see directories lile ports, rsaref2, scripts)

When you run configure, the Right Thing will happen.

Be advised that the RSA DES code is not quite as portable os one might
wish for.  In particular, DES under NTP will only work between machines
of the same "endianness".

Dave would prefer that new/alternative encryption schemes follow the
RSA API.
