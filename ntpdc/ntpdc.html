<h2 class="unnumbered">ntpdc: NTPD Control User Manual</h2>

<p>This document describes the use of the NTP Project's <code>ntpdc</code> program,
that can be used to query a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server and
display the time offset of the system clock relative to the server
clock.  Run as root, it can correct the system clock to this offset as
well.  It can be run as an interactive command or from a cron job.

  <p>This document applies to version 4.2.7p338 of <code>ntpdc</code>.

  <p>The program implements the SNTP protocol as defined by RFC 5905, the NTPv4
IETF specification.

<h3 class="section">Description</h3>

<p>By default, <code>ntpdc</code> writes the local data and time (i.e., not UTC) to the
standard output in the format:

<pre class="example">     1996-10-15 20:17:25.123 (+0800) +4.567 +/- 0.089 secs
</pre>
  <p>where
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SUBSEC is the local date and time,
(+0800) is the local timezone adjustment (so we would add 8 hours and 0 minutes to convert the reported local time to UTC),
and
the +4.567 +/- 0.089 secs indicates the time offset and
error bound of the system clock relative to the server clock.

<p><a name="index-ntpdc-1"></a><a name="index-vendor_002dspecific-NTPD-control-program-2"></a>

  <p><code>ntpdc</code>
is a utility program used to query
<code>ntpd(8)</code>
about its
current state and to request changes in that state. 
It uses NTP mode 7 control message formats described in the source code. 
The program may
be run either in interactive mode or controlled using command line
arguments. 
Extensive state and statistics information is available
through the
<code>ntpdc</code>
interface. 
In addition, nearly all the
configuration options which can be specified at startup using
ntpd's configuration file may also be specified at run time using
<code>ntpdc</code>.

  <p>This section was generated by <strong>AutoGen</strong>,
using the <code>agtexi-cmd</code> template and the option descriptions for the <code>ntpdc</code> program. 
This software is released under the NTP license, &lt;http://ntp.org/license&gt;.

This is the automatically generated usage text for ntpdc.

  <p>The text printed is the same whether selected with the <code>help</code> option
(<samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp>) or the <code>more-help</code> option (<samp><span class="option">--more-help</span></samp>).  <code>more-help</code> will print
the usage text by passing it through a pager program. 
<code>more-help</code> is disabled on platforms without a working

<h4 class="subsection">presetting/configuring ntpdc</h4>

<p>Any option that is not marked as <i>not presettable</i> may be preset by
loading values from configuration ("rc" or "ini") files, and values from environment variables named <code>NTPDC</code> and <code>NTPDC_&lt;OPTION_NAME&gt;</code>.  <code>&lt;OPTION_NAME&gt;</code> must be one of
the options listed above in upper case and segmented with underscores. 
The <code>NTPDC</code> variable will be tokenized and parsed like
the command line.  The remaining variables are tested for existence and their
values are treated like option arguments.

<p class="noindent"><code>libopts</code> will search in 2 places for configuration files:
     <ul>
<li>$HOME
<li>$PWD
</ul>
  The environment variables <code>HOME</code>, and <code>PWD</code>
are expanded and replaced when <samp><span class="file">ntpdc</span></samp> runs. 
For any of these that are plain files, they are simply processed. 
For any that are directories, then a file named <samp><span class="file">.ntprc</span></samp> is searched for
within that directory and processed.

  <p>Configuration files may be in a wide variety of formats. 
The basic format is an option name followed by a value (argument) on the
same line.  Values may be separated from the option name with a colon,
equal sign or simply white space.  Values may be continued across multiple
lines by escaping the newline with a backslash.

  <p>Multiple programs may also share the same initialization file. 
Common options are collected at the top, followed by program specific
segments.  The segments are separated by lines like:
<pre class="example">    [NTPDC]
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">or by
<pre class="example">    &lt;?program ntpdc&gt;
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">Do not mix these styles within one configuration file.

  <p>Compound values and carefully constructed string values may also be
specified using XML syntax:
<pre class="example">    &lt;option-name&gt;
       &lt;sub-opt&gt;...&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;...&lt;/sub-opt&gt;
    &lt;/option-name&gt;
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">yielding an <code>option-name.sub-opt</code> string value of
<pre class="example">    "...&lt;...&gt;..."
</pre>
  <p><code>AutoOpts</code> does not track suboptions.  You simply note that it is a
hierarchicly valued option.  <code>AutoOpts</code> does provide a means for searching
the associated name/value pair list (see: optionFindValue).

  <p>The command line options relating to configuration and/or usage help are:

<h5 class="subsubheading">version (-)</h5>

<p>Print the program version to standard out, optionally with licensing
information, then exit 0.  The optional argument specifies how much licensing
detail to provide.  The default is to print just the version.  The licensing infomation may be selected with an option argument.  Only the
first letter of the argument is examined:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">version</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Only print the version.  This is the default. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">copyright</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Name the copyright usage licensing terms.

<h4 class="subsection">ntpdc Usage</h4>

<p>If one or more request options are included on the command line
when
<code>ntpdc</code>
is executed, each of the requests will be sent
to the NTP servers running on each of the hosts given as command
line arguments, or on localhost by default. 
If no request options
are given,
<code>ntpdc</code>
will attempt to read commands from the
standard input and execute these on the NTP server running on the
first host given on the command line, again defaulting to localhost
when no other host is specified. 
The
<code>ntpdc</code>
utility will prompt for
commands if the standard input is a terminal device.

  <p>The
<code>ntpdc</code>
utility uses NTP mode 7 packets to communicate with the
NTP server, and hence can be used to query any compatible server on
the network which permits it. 
Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol
this communication will be somewhat unreliable, especially over
large distances in terms of network topology. 
The
<code>ntpdc</code>
utility makes
no attempt to retransmit requests, and will time requests out if
the remote host is not heard from within a suitable timeout
time.

  <p>The operation of
<code>ntpdc</code>
are specific to the particular
implementation of the
<code>ntpd(8)</code>
daemon and can be expected to
work only with this and maybe some previous versions of the daemon. 
Requests from a remote
<code>ntpdc</code>
utility which affect the
state of the local server must be authenticated, which requires
both the remote program and local server share a common key and key
identifier.

  <p>Note that in contexts where a host name is expected, a
<code>-4</code> qualifier preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace,
while a
<code>-6</code> qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace. 
Specifying a command line option other than
<code>-i</code> or
<code>-n</code> will cause the specified query (queries) to be sent to
the indicated host(s) immediately. 
Otherwise,
<code>ntpdc</code>
will
attempt to read interactive format commands from the standard
input. 
<div class="node">
<a name="Interactive-Commands"></a>

<h3 class="section">Interactive Commands</h3>

<p>Interactive Commands
Interactive format commands consist of a keyword followed by zero
to four arguments. 
Only enough characters of the full keyword to
uniquely identify the command need be typed. 
The output of a
command is normally sent to the standard output, but optionally the
output of individual commands may be sent to a file by appending a
\&amp;&gt; ,
followed by a file name, to the command line.

  <p>A number of interactive format commands are executed entirely
within the
<code>ntpdc</code>
utility itself and do not result in NTP
mode 7 requests being sent to a server. 
These are described
following.
     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">Ic</span><br><dt><span class="samp">Ic</span><dd>A
Ic \&amp;? 
will print a list of all the command
keywords known to this incarnation of
<code>ntpdc</code>. 
A
Ic \&amp;? 
followed by a command keyword will print function and usage
information about the command. 
This command is probably a better
source of information about
<code>ntpq(8)</code>
than this manual
page. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Specify a time interval to be added to timestamps included in
requests which require authentication. 
This is used to enable
(unreliable) server reconfiguration over long delay network paths
or between machines whose clocks are unsynchronized. 
Actually the
server does not now require timestamps in authenticated requests,
so this command may be obsolete. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Set the host to which future queries will be sent.

The
default is about 8000 milliseconds.

     <p>Control Message Commands
Query commands result in NTP mode 7 packets containing requests for
information being sent to the server. 
These are read-only commands
in that they make no modification of the server configuration
state.
          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Obtains and prints a brief list of the peers for which the
server is maintaining state. 
These should include all configured
peer associations as well as those peers whose stratum is such that
they are considered by the server to be possible future
synchronization candidates. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Obtains a list of peers for which the server is maintaining
state, along with a summary of that state. 
Summary information
includes the address of the remote peer, the local interface
address (0.0.0.0 if a local address has yet to be determined), the
stratum of the remote peer (a stratum of 16 indicates the remote
peer is unsynchronized), the polling interval, in seconds, the
reachability register, in octal, and the current estimated delay,
offset and dispersion of the peer, all in seconds.

          <p>The character in the left margin indicates the mode this peer
entry is operating in. 
A
&lsquo;\&amp;+&rsquo;
denotes symmetric active, a
&lsquo;\&amp;-&rsquo;
indicates symmetric passive, a
&lsquo;\&amp;=&rsquo;
means the
remote server is being polled in client mode, a
&lsquo;\&amp;^&rsquo;
indicates that the server is broadcasting to this address, a
&lsquo;\&amp;~&rsquo;
denotes that the remote peer is sending broadcasts and a
&lsquo;\&amp;~&rsquo;
denotes that the remote peer is sending broadcasts and a
&lsquo;\&amp;*&rsquo;
marks the peer the server is currently synchronizing
to.

          <p>The contents of the host field may be one of four forms. 
It may
be a host name, an IP address, a reference clock implementation
name with its parameter or
.Fn
REFCLK
"implementation_number"
"parameter"
. 
On

will be displayed. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A slightly different peer summary list. 
Identical to the output
of the

Most of these values are described in the NTP
Version 2 specification.

peer(s). 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Obtain and print information concerning a peer clock.

<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Print the values of selected loop filter variables. 
The loop
filter is the part of NTP which deals with adjusting the local
system clock. 
The
&lsquo;offset&rsquo;
is the last offset given to the
loop filter by the packet processing code. 
The
&lsquo;frequency&rsquo;
is the frequency error of the local clock in parts-per-million
(ppm). 
The
&lsquo;time_const&rsquo;
controls the stiffness of the
phase-lock loop and thus the speed at which it can adapt to
oscillator drift. 
The
&lsquo;watchdogtimer&rsquo;
value is the number
of seconds which have elapsed since the last sample offset was
given to the loop filter. 
The
<code>oneline</code> and
<code>multiline</code> options specify the format in which this
information is to be printed, with
<code>multiline</code> as the
default. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Print a variety of system state variables, i.e., state related
to the local server. 
All except the last four lines are described
in the NTP Version 3 specification, RFC-1305.

          <p>The
&lsquo;systemflags&rsquo;
show various system flags, some of
which can be set and cleared by the
<code>enable</code> and
<code>disable</code> configuration commands, respectively. 
These are
the
<code>auth</code>, <code>bclient</code>, <code>monitor</code>, <code>pll</code>, <code>pps</code> and
<code>stats</code> flags. 
See the
<code>ntpd(8)</code>
documentation for the meaning of these flags. 
There
are two additional flags which are read only, the
<code>kernel_pll</code> and
<code>kernel_pps</code>. These flags indicate
the synchronization status when the precision time kernel
modifications are in use. 
The
&lsquo;kernel_pll&rsquo;
indicates that
the local clock is being disciplined by the kernel, while the
&lsquo;kernel_pps&rsquo;
indicates the kernel discipline is provided by the PPS
signal.

          <p>The
&lsquo;stability&rsquo;
is the residual frequency error remaining
after the system frequency correction is applied and is intended for
maintenance and debugging. 
In most architectures, this value will
initially decrease from as high as 500 ppm to a nominal value in
the range .01 to 0.1 ppm. 
If it remains high for some time after

<p><hr>


</div>

<h3 class="section">Runtime Configuration Requests</h3>

          <p>Runtime Configuration Requests
All requests which cause state changes in the server are
authenticated by the server using a configured NTP key (the
facility can also be disabled by the server by not configuring a
key). 
The key number and the corresponding key must also be made
known to
<code>ntpdc</code>. 
This can be done using the
<code>keyid</code> and
<code>passwd</code> commands, the latter of which will prompt at the terminal for a
password to use as the encryption key. 
You will also be prompted
automatically for both the key number and password the first time a
command which would result in an authenticated request to the
server is given. 
Authentication not only provides verification that
the requester has permission to make such changes, but also gives
an extra degree of protection again transmission errors.

            <p>Authenticated requests always include a timestamp in the packet
data, which is included in the computation of the authentication
code. 
This timestamp is compared by the server to its receive time
stamp. 
If they differ by more than a small amount the request is
rejected. 
This is done for two reasons. 
First, it makes simple
replay attacks on the server, by someone who might be able to
overhear traffic on your LAN, much more difficult. 
Second, it makes
it more difficult to request configuration changes to your server
from topologically remote hosts. 
While the reconfiguration facility
will work well with a server on the local host, and may work
adequately between time-synchronized hosts on the same LAN, it will
work very poorly for more distant hosts. 
As such, if reasonable
passwords are chosen, care is taken in the distribution and
protection of keys and appropriate source address restrictions are
applied, the run time reconfiguration facility should provide an
adequate level of security.

            <p>The following commands all make authenticated requests.
               <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Xo</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>[<kbd>keyid</kbd> ]
[<kbd>version</kbd> ]
[<code>prefer</code> ]
Add a configured peer association at the given address and
operating in symmetric active mode. 
Note that an existing
association with the same peer may be deleted when this command is
executed, or may simply be converted to conform to the new
configuration, as appropriate. 
If the optional
<kbd>keyid</kbd> is a
nonzero integer, all outgoing packets to the remote server will
have an authentication field attached encrypted with this key. 
If
the value is 0 (or not given) no authentication will be done. 
The
<kbd>version</kbd> can be 1, 2 or 3 and defaults to 3. 
The
<code>prefer</code> keyword indicates a preferred peer (and thus will
be used primarily for clock synchronisation if possible). 
The
preferred peer also determines the validity of the PPS signal - if
the preferred peer is suitable for synchronisation so is the PPS
signal. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Xo</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>[<kbd>keyid</kbd> ]
[<kbd>version</kbd> ]
[<code>prefer</code> ]
Identical to the addpeer command, except that the operating
mode is client. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Xo</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>[<kbd>keyid</kbd> ]
[<kbd>version</kbd> ]
[<code>prefer</code> ]
Identical to the addpeer command, except that the operating
mode is broadcast. 
In this case a valid key identifier and key are
required. 
The
<kbd>peer_address</kbd> parameter can be the broadcast
address of the local network or a multicast group address assigned
to NTP. 
If a multicast address, a multicast-capable kernel is
required. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ic</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This command causes the configured bit to be removed from the
specified peer(s). 
In many cases this will cause the peer
association to be deleted. 
When appropriate, however, the
association may persist in an unconfigured mode if the remote peer
is willing to continue on in this fashion. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Xo</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>[<code>time1</code> ]
[<code>time2</code> ]
[<kbd>stratum</kbd> ]
[<kbd>refid</kbd> ]

                    <p>The
<code>ntpdc</code>
utility is a crude hack. 
Much of the information it shows is
deadly boring and could only be loved by its implementer. 
The
program was designed so that new (and temporary) features were easy
to hack in, at great expense to the program's ease of use. 
Despite
this, the program is occasionally useful.

<h3 class="section">Usage</h3>

                    <p>The simplest use of this program is as an unprivileged command to
check the current time, offset, and error in the local clock. 
For example:

                    <pre class="example">                        ntpdc ntpserver.somewhere
</pre>
                      <p>With suitable privilege, it can be run as a command or in a
<code>cron</code> job to reset the local clock from a reliable server, like
the <code>ntpdate</code> and <code>rdate</code> commands. 
For example:

                    <pre class="example">                        ntpdc -a ntpserver.somewhere
</pre>
