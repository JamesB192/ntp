.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-4\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-ipv4\f[]
Force IPv4 DNS name resolution.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
ipv6.
.sp
Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.

run a command and exit.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.
.sp
The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format command
and is added to the list of commands to be executed on the specified
host(s).

.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-n\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-numeric\f[]
numeric host addresses.
.sp
Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric format rather than
converting to the canonical host names.

.SH "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
environment variables named:
.nf
  \fBNTPDC_<option-name>\fP or \fBNTPDC\fP
.fi
.ad
The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than)
the configuration files.
The \fIhomerc\fP files are "\fI$HOME\fP", and "\fI.\fP".
If any of these are directories, then the file \fI.ntprc\fP
is searched for within those directories.
