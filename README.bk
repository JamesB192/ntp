In order to use the BitKeeper repository version of NTP you will have
to have the following tools installed:

	autoconf	2.50 or later
	automake
	lynx

Lynx is used to generate the COPYRIGHT file.  Don't ask.

Once you have obtained the sources, do the following:

	bk -r get   (or edit)	to check out the files
	autoreconf		generates configure and Makefile.in's

and you should be ready to go.
