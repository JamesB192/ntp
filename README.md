# ntp

Sometimes updated fast export/import of bk.ntp.org

This is probably no longer quite as useful since
https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp.git is mirorring
the BitKeeper repository again.

## The branches are:
- main/master
  - this one which only has this README
- ntp-devel:
  - analogous to ntp-dev on bk.ntp.org
- ntp-stable:
  - analogous to ntp-stable on bk.ntp.org

## mirrors are at
- https://bitbucket.org/jamesb192/ntp
- https://github.com/jamesb192/ntp.git
- https://gitlab.com/jamesb_fe80/ntp.git
