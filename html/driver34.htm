<hr>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>
Address: 127.127.34.<i>u</i><br>
Reference ID: <TT>ULINK</TT><br>

<br>Features: <tt>(none)</tt>
<h4>Description</h4>
This driver supports the Ultralink Model 320 RS-232 powered WWVB receiver.  PDF specs available on <a href="http://www.linuxfoundary.com">www.linuxfoundary.com</a>.    While the unit may support them, this driver does nothing with leap seconds, quality codes, etc. (though it probably should).

<P>Most of this code is originally from refclock_wwvb.c with thanks.  Any mistakes are mine.  Any improvements are welcome.

<pre>
  The timecode format is:
 
   <cr><lf>SQRYYYYDDD+HH:MM:SS.mmLT<cr>
 
  where:
 
  S = 'S' -- sync'd in last hour, '0'-'9' - hours x 10 since last update, else '?'
  Q = Number of correlating time-frames, from 0 to 5
  R = 'R' -- reception in progress, 'N' -- Noisy reception, ' ' -- standby mode
  YYYY = year from 1990 to 2089
  DDD = current day from 1 to 366
  + = '+' if current year is a leap year, else ' '
  HH = UTC hour 0 to 23
  MM = Minutes of current hour from 0 to 59
  SS = Seconds of current minute from 0 to 59
  mm = 10's milliseconds of the current second from 00 to 99
  L  = Leap second pending at end of month -- 'I' = inset, 'D'=delete
  T  = DST <-> STD transition indicators
 
  Note that this driver does not do anything with the L or T flags.
 
  The M320 also has a 'U' command which returns UT1 correction information.  It
  is not used in this driver.
