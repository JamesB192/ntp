Shared Memory Driver</H3>

<HR>
<H4>
Synopsis</H4>
Address: 127.127.28.<I>u</I>
<BR>Reference ID: <TT>SHM</TT>
<BR>Driver ID: <TT>SHM</TT>
<H4>
Description</H4>
This driver receives its reference clock info from a shared memory-segment.
The shared memory-segment is created with owner-only access for unit 0
and 1, and world access for unit 2 and 3
<H4>
Structure of shared memory-segment</H4>

                *       values is equal,

                *       clear valid

<H4>
Operation mode=0</H4>
When the poll-method of the driver is called, the valid-flag of the shared
memory-segment is checked:

<P>If set, the values in the record (clockTimeStampSec, clockTimeStampUSec,
receiveTimeStampSec, receiveTimeStampUSec, leap, precision) are passed
to ntp, and the valid-flag is cleared.

<P>If not set, a timeout is reported to ntp, nothing else happend
<H4>
Operation mode=1</H4>
When the poll-method of the driver is called, the valid-flag of the shared
memory-segment is checked:

<P>If set, the count-field of the record is remembered, and the values
in the record (clockTimeStampSec, clockTimeStampUSec, receiveTimeStampSec,
receiveTimeStampUSec, leap, precision) are read. Then, the remembered count
is compared to the count now in the record. If both are equal, the values
read from the record are passed to ntp. If they differ, another process
has modified the record while it was read out (was not able to produce
this case), and failure is reported to ntp. The valid flag is cleared.

<P>If not set, a timeout is reported to ntp, nothing else happend
