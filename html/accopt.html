        <tt>ntpd</tt> implements a general purpose address/mask based restriction list. The list contains address/match entries sorted first by increasing address values and and then by increasing mask values. A match occurs when the bitwise AND of the mask and the packet source address is equal to the bitwise AND of the mask and address in the list. The list is searched in order with the last match found defining the restriction flags associated with the entry. Additional information and examples can be found in the <a href="notes.html">Notes on Configuring NTP and Setting up a NTP Subnet</a> page.
        <p>The restriction facility was implemented in conformance with the access policies for the original NSFnet backbone time servers. Later the facility was expanded to deflect cryptographic and clogging attacks. While this facility may be useful for keeping unwanted or broken or malicious clients from congesting innocent servers, it should not be considered an alternative to the NTP authentication facilities. Source address based restrictions are easily circumvented by a determined cracker.</p>
        <p>Clients can be denied service because they are explicitly included in the restrict list created by the <tt>restrict</tt> command or implicitly as the result of cryptographic or rate limit violations. Cryptographic violations include certificate or identity verification failure; rate limit violations generally result from multiple clients from the same network congesting the server . Cryptographic violations cause the single offender to be denied further access, while rate limit violations cause the entire network to be denied access. When a client or network is denied access for these reasons, the only way at present to remove the restrictions is by restarting the server.</p>
        <h4 id="#kiss">The Kiss-of-Death Packet</h4>
        <p>Ordinarily, packets denied service are simply dropped with no further action except incrementing statistics counters. Sometimes a more proactive response is needed, such as a server message that explicitly requests the client to stop sending and leave a message for the system operator. A special packet format has been created for this purpose called the &quot;kiss-of-death&quot; (KOD) packet. KOD packets have the leap bits set unsynchronized and stratum set to zero and the reference identifier field set to a four-byte ASCII code. If the <tt>noserve</tt> flag of the matching restrict list entry is set, the code is &quot;DENY&quot;; if the <tt>limited</tt> flag is set and the rate limit is exceeded, the code is &quot;RATE&quot;. Finally, if a cryptographic violation occurs, the code is &quot;CRYP&quot;.</p>
        <p>A client receiving a KOD performs a set of sanity checks to minimize security exposure, then updates the stratum and reference identifier peer variables, sets the access denied (TEST4) bit in the peer flash variable and sends a message to the log. As long as the TEST4 bit is set, the client will send no further packets to the server. The only way at present to recover from this condition is to restart the protocol at both the client and server. This happens automatically at the client when the association times out. It will happen at the server only if the server operator cooperates.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><tt>restrict <i>numeric_address</i> [mask <i>numeric_mask</i>] [<i>flag</i>][...]</tt>
            <dd>The <i><tt>numeric_address</tt></i> argument, expressed in dotted-quad form, is the address of a host or network. The <i><tt>mask</tt></i> argument, also expressed in dotted-quad form, defaults to <tt>255.255.255.255</tt>, meaning that the <i><tt>numeric_address</tt></i> is treated as the address of an individual host. A default entry (address <tt>0.0.0.0</tt>, mask <tt>0.0.0.0</tt>) is always included and, given the sort algorithm, is always the first entry in the list. Note that, while <i><tt>numeric_address</tt></i> is normally given in dotted-quad format, the text string <tt>default</tt>, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the default entry.
            <dd>In the current implementation, <i><tt>flag</tt></i> always restricts access, i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that free access to the server is to be given. The flags are not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive ones redundant. The flags can generally be classed into two catagories, those which restrict time service and those which restrict informational queries and attempts to do run-time reconfiguration of the server. One or more of the following flags may be specified:
            <dl>
                <dt><tt>kod</tt>
                <dd>An access violation normally results in an automatic kiss-of-death (KOD) packet, after which the <tt>kod</tt> flag is seet to prevent further KOD packets. If the <tt>kod</tt> flag is set in the <tt>restrict</tt> command, a KOD packet will not be sent.
                <dt><tt>ignore</tt>
                <dd>Ignore all packets from hosts which match this entry. If this flag is specified neither queries nor time server polls will be responded to.
                <dt><tt>noquery</tt>
                <dd>Ignore all NTP mode 6 and 7 packets (i.e. information queries and configuration requests) from the source. Time service is not affected.
                <dt><tt>nomodify</tt>
                <dd>Ignore all NTP mode 6 and 7 packets which attempt to modify the state of the server (i.e. run time reconfiguration). Queries which return information are permitted.
                <dt><tt>notrap</tt>
                <dd>Decline to provide mode 6 control message trap service to matching hosts. The trap service is a subsystem of the mode 6 control message protocol which is intended for use by remote event logging programs.
                <dt><tt>lowpriotrap</tt>
                <dd>Declare traps set by matching hosts to be low priority. The number of traps a server can maintain is limited (the current limit is 3). Traps are usually assigned on a first come, first served basis, with later trap requestors being denied service. This flag modifies the assignment algorithm by allowing low priority traps to be overridden by later requests for normal priority traps.
                <dt><tt>noserve</tt>
                <dd>Ignore NTP packets whose mode is other than 6 or 7. In effect, time service is denied, though queries may still be permitted.
                <dt><tt>nopeer</tt>
                <dd>Provide stateless time service to polling hosts, but do not allocate peer memory resources to these hosts even if they otherwise might be considered useful as future synchronization partners.
                <dt><tt>notrust</tt>
                <dd>Treat these hosts normally in other respects, but never use them as synchronization sources.
                <dt><tt>limited</tt>
                <dd>These hosts are subject to limitation of number of clients from the same net. Net in this context refers to the IP notion of net (class A, class B, class C, etc.). Only the first <tt>client_limit</tt> hosts that have shown up at the server and that have been active during the last <tt>client_limit_period</tt> seconds are accepted. Requests from other clients from the same net are rejected. Only time request packets are taken into account. Query packets sent by the <tt>ntpq</tt> and <tt>ntpdc</tt> programs are not subject to these limits. A history of clients is kept using the monitoring capability of <tt>ntpd</tt>. Thus, monitoring is always active as long as there is a restriction entry with the <tt>limited</tt> flag.
                <dt><tt>ntpport</tt>
                <dd>This is actually a match algorithm modifier, rather than a restriction flag. Its presence causes the restriction entry to be matched only if the source port in the packet is the standard NTP UDP port (123). Both <tt>ntpport</tt> and <tt>non-ntpport</tt> may be specified. The <tt>ntpport</tt> is considered more specific and is sorted later in the list.
                <dt><tt>version</tt>
                <dd>Ignore these hosts if not the current NTP version.
            </dl>
            <dd>Default restriction list entries, with the flags <tt>ignore, interface, ntpport</tt>, for each of the local host's interface addresses are inserted into the table at startup to prevent the server from attempting to synchronize to its own time. A default entry is also always present, though if it is otherwise unconfigured; no flags are associated with the default entry (i.e., everything besides your own NTP server is unrestricted).
            <dt><tt>clientlimit <i>limit</i></tt>
            <dd>Set the <tt>client_limit</tt> variable, which limits the number of simultaneous access-controlled clients. The default value for this variable is 3.
            <dt><tt>clientperiod <i>period</i></tt>
            <dd>Set the <tt>client_limit_period</tt> variable, which specifies the number of seconds after which a client is considered inactive and thus no longer is counted for client limit restriction. The default value for this variable is 3600 seconds.
