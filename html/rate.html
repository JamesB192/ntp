		<h4 id="intro">Introduction</h4>
		<p>Some national time metrology laboratories, including NIST and USNO, use the <tt>ntpd</tt> reference implementation in their very busy public time servers. They operate multiple servers behind load-balancing devices to support aggregate rates up to several thousand packets per second. The servers need to defend themselves against all manner of broken implementations that can clog the server and and network infrastructure. On the other hand, friendly <tt>ntpd</tt> clients need to avoid configurations that can result in unfriendly rates.</p>
		<p>There are several features in <tt>ntpd</tt> designed to defend the servers, clients and network against accidental or intentional flood attack. On the other hand these features are also used to insure <tt>ntpd</tt> is a good citizen, even if configured in unfriendly ways. The ground rules are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Send at the lowest rate consistent with the required nominal error regime.<li>Maintain strict minimum average headway and guard times, even if multiple burst options and/or the Autokey protocol are operating.<li>When the first packet of a burst is sent to a server, do not send further packets until the first packet has been received from the server.<li>Upon receiving a Kiss-o'-Death packet (see below), immediately reduce the sending rate.
		</ul>
		<p>Rate management involves four algorithms to manage resources: (1) poll rate control, (2) burst control, (3) average headway time and (4) guard time. These are described in following sections.</p>
		<h4 id="poll">Poll Rate Control</h4>
		<p>In the <tt>ntpd</tt> design control of the poll interval is an intricate balance between nominal errors and network load. As a rule of thumb, the nominal errors double for a fourfold increase in poll interval. As the poll interval increases from 64 s to 1024 s, for example, the nominal errors ecrease by a factor of four. Nevertheless and unless the lowest possible nominal error is required, the well mannered NTP client should allow the interval to increase to the maximum when possible.</p>
		<p>The poll interval is proportional to the time constant of the feedback loop which disciplines the system clock. The optimum time constant depends on the network time jitter and the clock oscillator frequency wander. Errors due to jitter are reduced as the time constant increases, while errors due to wander are decreased as the time constant decreases. The two error characteristics intersect at a point called the Allan intercept, which represents the ideal time constant. The <tt>ntpd</tt> poll interval algorithms slowly increases the poll interval when jitter dominates the error budget, but quickly reduces the interval when wander dominates it.</p>
		<p>In <tt>ntpd</tt> the poll interval is represented in log<sub>2</sub> s, so the actual values span the range 6-10. The algorithm uses a jiggle counter which operates over the range from -30 to +30 and is initialized at 0. If the measured offset is less than four times the measured average jitter, the counter is increased by the poll interval; if not, it is decreased by twice the poll interval. If the counter reaches +30, the poll interval is incremented by 1; if the counter reaches -30, the poll interval is decremented by 1. In either case the counter is set to 0.</p>
		<h4 id="burst">Burst Control</h4>
		<p>Occasionally it is necessary to send packets at intervals less than the poll interval. For instance, with the burst and iburst options, the poll algorithm sends a burst of several packets at 2-s intervals. The <tt>ntpd</tt> poll algorithm avoids sending needless packets if the server is not responding. If a burst is to be sent, the client sends only a single packet. When the first packet is received from the server, the client continues with the remaining packets in the burst. If the first packet is not received within 64 s, it will be sent again for two additional retries before giving up. The result is to minimize network load if the server is not responding.</p>
		<p>For the iburst option the number of packets in the burst is six, which is the number normally needed to synchronize the clock; for the burst option, the number of packets in the burst is determined by the difference between the poll interval and the minimum poll interval set by the <tt>minpoll</tt> option of the <tt>server</tt> command. For instance, at a poll interval of 6 (64 s), only a single packet is sent for every poll, while the full number of eight packets is sent at poll intervals of 9 (512 s) or more.</p>
		<h4 id="mah">Average Headway Time</h4>
		<p>There are features in <tt>ntpd</tt> to manage the interval between one packet and the next. These features make use of a set of counters: an output counter for each client association and an input counter for each distinct client address. Each counter increments by a value called the headway when a packet is processed and decrements by one each second. The default headway in <tt>ntpd</tt> is 16 s, but this can be changed using the <tt>average</tt> option of the <tt>discard</tt> command.</p>
		<p>If the iburst or burst options are present, the poll algorithm sends a burst of packets instead of a single packet at each poll opportunity. The NTPv4 specification requires that bursts contain no more than eight packets; so, starting from an output counter value of zero, the maximum counter value or ouput ceiling can be no more than eight times the minimum poll interval set by the <tt>minpoll</tt> option of the <tt>server</tt> command. However, if the burst starts with a counter value other than zero, there is a potential to exceed the ceiling. The poll algorithm avoids this by computing an additional headway time so that the next packet sent will not exceed the ceiling. Additional headway time can result from Autokey protocol operations. Designs such as this are often called leaky buckets.</p>
		<p>The <tt>ntpd</tt> input packet routine uses a special list of entries, one for each distinct client address found. Each entry includes an IP address, input counter and time of the most recent arrival. The entries are ordered by time of arrival, most recent first. As each packet arrives, the IP source address is compared to the IP address in each entry in turn. If a match is found the entry is removed and inserted first on the list. If the IP source address does not match any entry, a new entry is created and inserted first, possibly discarding the last entry on the list if it is full. Observers will note this is the same algorithm used for page replacement in virtual memory systems.</p>
		<p>In the virtual memory algorithm the entry of interest is the last, whereas here the entry of interest is the first. The input counter is decreased by the time since it was last referenced, but not below zero. If the value of the counter plus the headway is greater than the input ceiling set by the <tt>average</tt> option of the <tt>discard</tt> command, the packet is discarded. Otherwise, the counter is increased by the headway and the packet is processed. The result is, if the client maintains a maximum average headway not less than the input ceiling and transmits no more than eight packets in a burst, the input counter will not exceed the input ceiling.</p>
		<h4 id="mgt">Guard Time</h4>
		<p>A review of past client abuse incidence shows the most frequent scenario is a broken client that attempts to send a number of packets at rates of one per second or more. There have been occasions where this abuse has persisted for days at a time. These scenarios are the most damaging, as they can threaten not only the victim server but the network infrastructure as well.</p>
		<p>In the <tt>ntpd</tt> server design the minimum headway between the last packet received and the current packet is called the guard time. If the headway is less than the guard time, the packet is discarded. The guard time defaults to 2 s, but this can be changed using the <tt>minimum</tt> option of the <tt>discard</tt> ommand.</p>
		<h4 id="kod">The Kiss-o'-Death Packet</h4>
		<p>As an optional feature <tt>ntpd</tt> can send a special packet called the Kiss-o'-Death (KoD) packet when either the average headway or guard time is violated. The KoD is a packet with leap bits 11, stratum 0 and reference ID field other than 0. In this case the reference ID field is a four-character ASCII string, called the kiss code, showing the reason for the KoD. The KoD is enabled by the <tt>limited kod</tt> options to the <tt>restrict</tt> command.</p>
		<p>At present, only one kiss code <tt>RATE</tt> is used to tell the client to slow down. In order to make sure the client notices the KoD, the receive and transmit timestamps are set to the transmit timestamp of the client packet and all other fields left as in the client packet. Thus, even if the client ignores the KoD, it cannot do any useful time computations. KoDs themselves are rate limited in the same way as arriving packets in order to deflect a flood attack.</p>
		<p>There is some controversy about the KoD provisions. The nature of the datagram service supporting NTP&nbsp;provides no way to throttle clients other than behaving badly. Clients are strongly advised to support the KoD, but there are no legal or societal statutes requiring it. The reference implementation responds to a KoD by temporarily increasing the ouptut counter and thus the headway.</p>
