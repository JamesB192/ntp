        <tt>ntp-keygen</tt>
        <h4 id="#desc">Description</h4>
        <p>This program generates cryptographic data files used by the NTPv4 authentication and identification schemes. It generates MD5 key files used in symmetric key cryptography. In addition, if the OpenSSL software library has been installed, it generates key, certificate and parameter files used in public key cryptography. These files are used for cookie encryption, digital signature and challenge/response identification algorithms compatible with the Internet standard security infrastructure.</p>
        <p>All files are in PEM-encoded printable ASCII format, so they can be embedded as MIME attachments in mail to other sites and certificate authorities. Files containing private values can be password encrypted. File names begin with the prefix <tt>ntpkey_</tt> and end with the postfix <tt><i>_hostname.filestamp</i></tt>, where <tt><i>hostname</i></tt> is the owner name, usually the string returned by the Unix <tt>gethostname()</tt> routine, and <tt><i>filestamp</i></tt> is the NTP seconds when the file was generated, in decimal digits. This both guarantees uniqueness and simplifies maintenance procedures, since all files can be quickly removed by a <tt>rm ntpkey*</tt> command or all files generated at a specific time can be removed by a <tt>rm *<i>filestamp</i></tt> command. To further reduce the risk of misconfiguration, the first two lines of a file contain the file name and generation date and time as comments.</p>
        <p>All files are installed by default in the keys directory <tt>/usr/local/etc</tt>, which is normally in a shared filesystem in NFS-mounted networks. The actual location of the keys directory or each file can be overridden by configuration commands, but this is not recommended. Normally, the files for each host are generated by that host and used only by that host, although exceptions exist as noted later on this page.</p>
        <p>Normally, files containing private values, including the host key, sign key and identification parameters, are permitted root read/write-only; while others containing public values are permitted world readable. Alternatively, files containing private values can be encrypted with a chosen password and all files permitted world readable, which simplifies maintenance in shared file systems. Since uniqueness is insured by the hostname and file name extensions, the files for a NFS server and dependent clients can all be installed in the same shared directory.</p>
        <p>The recommended practice is to keep the file name extensions when installing a file and to install a soft link from the generic names specified elsewhere on this page to the generated files. This allows new file generations to be activated simply by changing the link. However, <tt>ntpd</tt> parses the link name when present to extract the filestamp and sends it along with the public key and host name when requested. This allows clients to verify that the file and generation times are always current. The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program uses the same timestamp extension for all files generated at one time, so each generation is distinct and can be readily recognized in monitoring data.</p>
        <p>As explained in the <a href="authopt.html">Authentication Options</a> page, all cryptographically sound key generation schemes must have means to randomize the entropy seed used to initialize the internal random number generator. The OpenSSL library uses a designated random seed file for this purpose. The file must be available when starting the NTP daemon and <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program. If a site supports OpenSSL or its companion OpenSSH, it is very likely that means to do this are already available.</p>
        <h4 id="#run">Running the program</h4>
        <p>The safest way to run the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program is logged in directly as root. The recommended procedure is change to the keys directory, usually <tt>/ust/local/etc</tt>, then run the program. When run for the first time, or if all <tt>ntpkey</tt> files have been removed, the program generates a RSA host key file and matching RSA-MD5 certificate file, which is all that is necessary in many cases. The program also generates soft links from the generic names to the respective files. If run again, the program uses the same host key file, but generates a new certificate file and link.</p>
        <p>The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be RSA type. By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt signatures. When necessary, a different sign key can be specified and this can be either RSA or DSA type. By default, the message digest type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified.</p>
        <p>Running the program as other than root and using the Unix <tt>su</tt> command to assume root may not work properly, since by default the OpenSSL library looks for the random seed file <tt>.rnd</tt> in the user home directory. However, there should be only one <tt>.rnd</tt>, most conveniently in the root directory, so it is convenient to define the <tt>$RANDFILE</tt> environment variable used by the OpenSSL library as the path to <tt>/.rnd</tt>.</p>
        <p>Installing the keys as root might not work in NFS-mounted shared file systems, as NFS clients may not be able to write to the shared keys directory, even as root. In this case, NFS clients can specify the files in another directory such as <tt>/etc</tt> using the <tt>keysdir</tt> command. There is no need for one client to read the keys and certificates of other clients or servers, as these data are obtained automatically by the Autokey protocol.</p>
        <p>Ordinarily, cryptographic files are generated by the host that uses them, but it is possible for a trusted host to generate these files for other hosts; however, in such cases the private values should always be password-encrypted. The password is supplied as an option to the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> command and as the <tt>pw</tt> subcommand in the <tt>ntpd</tt> cofiguration file. It is convenient to designate the owner name and trusted name as the subject and issuer fields, respectivily, of the certificate. The owner name is also used for the host and sign key files, while the trusted name is used for the identity files.</p>
        <h4 id="#exam">Trusted Hosts and Groups</h4>
        <p>Each cryptographic configuration involves selection of a signature scheme and identification scheme, called a cryptotype, as explained in the <a href="authopt.html">Authentication Options</a> page. The default cryptotype uses RSA encryption, MD5 message digest and default (TC) identification. First, configure a NTP subnet including a number of low-stratum time servers from which all other subnet members derive synchronization directly or indirectly. These servers are considered trusted and will have trusted certificates. All others will automatically and dynamically build authoritative certificate trails to these servers.</p>
        <p>On each trusted server as root, change to the keys directory. To insure a fresh fileset, remove all <tt>ntpkey</tt> files. Then run <tt>ntp-keygen -T</tt> to generate keys and a trusted certificate. On all other hosts do the same, but leave off the <tt>-T</tt> flag to generate keys and nontrusted certificates. When complete, start the NTP daemons beginning at the lowest stratum and working up the tree. It may take some time for Autokey to instantiate the certificate trails throughout the subnet, but setting up the environment is completely automatic.</p>
<p>It is important that every group be able to construct a certificate trail to one or more trusted hosts in the same group. Ordinarily, each host on the trail to a trusted host has certificates for all hosts along the trail, so a host can hike the trail by fetching each in turn until a trusted host is found. This requires all NTP configuration files to specify servers known to be in the group. If the certificate trail is broken so that no trusted host can be found, a host will loop forever (at low rate) until a path comes available.
        <p>A host can be a member of more than one group if it has the necessary credentials. It might be the case, for example, that the servers in one corporation be members of the corporate group, as well as members of a national standards group from which it imports time. In such cases a host exports its home group when operating as a server and imports the group of each association separately when operating as a client. For instance, server alice exports the her own credentials to dependent clients, but  imports the credentials from the certificate trail of each client association specific to that association.</p>
        <p>After setting up the environment it is advisable to update certificates from time to time, if only to extend the validity interval. Simply run <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> with the same flags as before to generate new certificates using existing keys. The next time <tt>ntpd</tt> is started, it will load the new certificate and restart the protocol. Since the keys have not changed, other dependent hosts will continue as usual until signatures are refreshed and the protocol is restarted, which occurs about once per day.</p>
<h4 id="#idexp">Identity Schemes</h4>

        <p>As mentioned on the Authentication Options page, the default TC identity scheme is vulnerable to a middleman attack. However, there are more secure identity schemes available, including PC, IFF, GQ and MV. These schemes are based on a trusted agent host and a group of hosts deriving trust from that host. The trusted agent is not necessarily one of the group hosts, bout often is. Group membership is defined by private values generated by the trusted agent and distributed by secure means to all group hosts.</p>
        <p>The PC scheme is set up as follows. On trusted agent <i>alice</i> run <tt>ntp-keygen -P -p <i>password</i></tt> to generate the encrypted host key and private certificate. Do not generate keys and certificates on the other group hosts. Note that, as with all encrypted files, the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program prompts for the password if it reads an encrypted file and the <tt>-p</tt> option is not present.</p>
        <p>Copy the host key file <tt>ntpkey_RSAkey_<i>alice.filestamp</i></tt> and certificate file <tt>ntpkey_RSA-MD5_cert_<i>alice.filestamp</i></tt> to all group hosts. On each host <i>bob</i> install a soft link from the generic name <tt>ntpkey_host_bob</tt> to the host key file and soft link <tt>ntpkey_cert_bob</tt> to the certificate file. Note the generic links are on <i>bob</i>, but point to files generated by <i>alice</i>. In this scheme it is not possible to refresh either the keys or certificates in any host without copying them to all other hosts in the group.</p>
        <p>For the IFF scheme and trusted agent <i>Alice</i>, run the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program with the <tt>-I -p <i>password</i></tt> options. Then proceed as in the TC scheme to generate keys and certificates for each group host. Then, copy the IFF parameters file <tt>ntpkeys_IFFpar_<i>alice.filestamp</i></tt> to all hosts in the group. On each host <i>bob</i> install a soft link from the generic <tt>ntpkey_iff_<i>alice</i></tt> to this file and a soft link from the generic <tt>ntpkey_iff_<i>bob</i></tt> to the same file. As the IFF scheme is independent of keys and certificates, these files can be refreshed as needed.</p>
        <p>For the GQ scheme and trusted agent <i>Alice</i>, run the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program with the <tt>-G -p <i>password</i></tt> options. Then proceed as in the TC scheme to generate keys and certificates for each group host. Then, copy the GQ parameters file <tt>ntpkeys_GQpar_<i>alice.filestamp</i></tt> to all group hosts. On each host <i>bob</i> install a soft link from the generic <tt>ntpkey_gq_<i>alice</i></tt> to this file and a soft link from the generic <tt>ntpkey_gq_<i>bob</i></tt> to the same file. As the GQ scheme updates the GQ parameters file and certificate at the same time, keys and certificates can be regenerated as needed.</p>
        <p>In the MV scheme the trusted agent generates server parameters, which are copied to all group hosts restricted to operate only as servers, and client parameters, which are copied to all group hosts restricted to operate only as clients. On trusted agent <i>Alice</i> run the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program with the <tt>-V&nbsp;<i>n</i> -p <i>password</i></tt> options, where <i>n</i> is the number of revokable keys, typically 5. Then, copy the MV parameters file <tt>ntpkeys_MVpar_<i>alice.filestamp</i></tt> to all group servers. On server <i>bob</i> install a soft link from the generic <tt>ntpkey_mv_<i>bob</i></tt> to this file. Select one of the <tt>ntpkeys_MVkey<i>k</i>_<i>alice.filestamp</i></tt> files (except the last)where <i><tt>k</tt></i> is the key number, and copy it to all group clients, including those servers that may become clients of other servers.  On client <i>dave</i> install a soft link from the generic <tt>ntpkey_mvkey_<i>alice</i></tt> to this file. As the MV scheme is independent of keys and certificates, these files can be refreshed as needed.</p>
        <p>If it is necessary to use a different sign key or different digest/signature scheme than the default, run <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> with the <tt>-S</tt> option and either <tt>RSA</tt> or <tt>DSA</tt> argument as needed. The most often need to do this is when a DSA-signed certificate is used. If <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> is run again without the option, it will generate a new certificate using the existing sign key. If it is necessary to use a different certificate scheme than the default, run <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> with the <tt>-c</tt> option and selected scheme as needed. If <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> is run again without the option, it will generate a new certificate using the same scheme and existing sign key.</p>

        </dl>
        <h4 id="#symkey">Symmetric Key File</h4>
        <p>The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program generates a MD5 symmetric keys file <tt>ntpkey_MD5key_<i>hostname.filestamp</i></tt>. Since the file contains private shared keys, it should be visible only to root and distributed by secure means to other subnet hosts. The NTP daemon loads the file <tt>ntp.keys</tt>, so <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> installs a soft link from this name to the generated file. Subsequently, similar soft links must be installed by manual or automated means on the other subnet hosts. While this file is not used with the Autokey Version 2 protocol, it is needed to authenticate some remote configuration commands used by the <a href="ntpdc.html"><tt>ntpq</tt></a> and <a href="ntpq.html"><tt>ntpdc</tt></a> utilities.</p>
        <p>The symmetric key file contains 16 MD5 keys. Each key consists of 16 characters randomized over the ASCII 93-character printing subset. The file is read by the daemon at the location specified by the <tt>keys</tt> configuration file command. Additional keys consisting of easily remembered passwords should be added by hand for use with the <tt>ntpq</tt> and <tt>ntpdc</tt> programs. While the key identifiers for MD5 keys must be in the range 1-65,535, inclusive, the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program uses only the identifiers from 1 to 16. The key identifier for each association is specified as the <tt>key</tt> subcommand with the <tt>server</tt> or <tt>peer</tt> configuration command.</p>
        <h4 id="#priv">Private Key Files</h4>
        <p>The Autokey protocol requires every host to have a private/public host key pair and an optional private/public sign key pair. The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program generates a private key file <tt>ntpkey_<i>keyname</i>key_<i>hostname.filestamp</i></tt>, where <i>keyname</i> is the name of the public key algorithm type, either <tt>RSA</tt> or <tt>DSA</tt>. Since the host key is used to encrypt some data, it must be RSA type; the sign key file can be a RSA or DSA type. These files contain private values, so should be encrypted or visible only to root. The NTP daemon loads the host key file <tt>ntpkey_host_<i>hostname</i></tt> and the sign key file <tt>ntpkey_sign_<i>hostname</i></tt>, so <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> installs soft links to direct these names to the generated files.</p>
        <h4 id="#ident">Identification Parameter Files</h4>
        <p>Of the four identification schemes implemented in Autokey, the IFF and GQ schemes require special parameters used as group keys, while the GQ scheme requires in addition a private/public key pair as well as a special certificate with the public key included in an X509v3 extension field. In both schemes parameter files are generated by a trusted host, then securely distributed to all other hosts in the group. These files contain private values, so should be encrypted or visible only to root. On Unix machines, a convenient way to do this might be the <tt>sdist</tt> facility often used to update the latest software within the administrative domain.</p>
        <p>The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program with the <tt>-I</tt> flag generates an IFF parameter file <tt>ntpkey_IFFpar_<i>hostname.filestamp</i></tt> and with the <tt>-G</tt> flag generates a GQ parameter file <tt>ntpkey_GQpar_<i>hostname.filestamp</i></tt>. The NTP daemon loads the IFF parameter file <tt>ntpkey_IFFpar_<i>hostname</i></tt> and the GQ parameter file <tt>ntpkey_GQpar_<i>hostname</i></tt>, so <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> installs soft links to direct these names to the generated files. Subsequently, similar soft links must be installed by manual or automated means on the other hosts in the group.</p>
        <p>When a certificate is generated for the GQ scheme, the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> also generates a GQ key file <tt>ntpkey_GQkey_<i>hostname.filestamp</i></tt>. The NTP daemon loads the GQ key file <tt>ntpkey_gq_<i>hostname</i></tt>, so the program installs a soft link to direct this name to the generated file. At the same time the program generates a special certificate with the public key component saved in the &quot;X509v3 Subject Key Identifier&quot; extension field. It is important to note that the GQ keys and certificates are generated at the same time and that they can be regenerated from time to time without requiring new GQ parameters.</p>
        <h4 id="#cert">Certificates</h4>
        <p>The Internet security infrastructure requires every host to have a digitally signed public certificate. Security procedures require the public key and host credentials, such as host name, responsible person, mail address, etc., to be provided in the form of a X.509 certificate request to a trusted certificate authority or CA. The CA attaches a digital signature to the request and returns the certificate with signature to the requesting party. The integrity of these procedures depend on the certificate trail that ultimately must end on a self-signed certificate provided by a trusted CA. The OpenSSL software library provides routines that can automate this process.</p>
        <p>Normally, the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program generates certificates which contain only public values, so they can be transmitted and stored without cryptographic protection. With the <tt>-P</tt> option the program generates a certificate including a &quot;X509v3 &quot;Extended Key Usage&quot; extension field with value <tt>private</tt> The intent when this field is present is never to disclose the certificate outside the host on which it is installed. Certificates generated without this option do not contain this field and are by default public.</p>
        <p>The Autokey TC identification scheme automates the certificate trail construction and verification process with each server at stratum <i>n</i> operating as a CA for clients at stratum <i>n</i> + 1. The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program generates a self-signed X.509v3 public certificate <tt>ntpkey_<i>digestname</i>cert_<i>hostname.filestamp</i></tt>, where <i>digestname</i> is the name of the digest/signature scheme. The NTP daemon loads the certificate <tt>ntpkey_cert_<i>hostname</i></tt>, so <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> installs soft links to direct this name to the generated file. The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program with the <tt>-T</tt> flag generates a trusted certificate including a &quot;X509v3 Extended Key Usage&quot; extension field with value <tt>trustRoot</tt>. Certificates generated without this option do not contain this field and are by default non-trusted.</p>
        <p>Public certificates contain only public values and can be freely transmitted and stored anywhere without further cryptographic protection, although this is rarely necessary. The Autokey protocol retrieves the server certificate and requests the server sign and return the client certificate. Where security considerations require, certificates can be transmitted to an outside trusted certificate authority (CA) and returned as a signed public certificate for use in the Autokey protocol.</p>
        <p>The Autokey protocol supports all digest/signature schemes available in the OpenSSL library, including those using the MD2, MD5, SHA, SHA1, MDC2 and RIPE160 message digest algorithms. However, the scheme specified in the certificate must be compatible with the sign key. Certificates using any digest algorithm are compatible with RSA sign keys; however, only SHA and SHA1 certificates are compatible with DSA sign keys.</p>
        <h4 id="#leap">Leapseconds Table</h4>
        <p>The NIST provides a file documenting the epoch for all historic occasions of leap second insertion since 1972. The leapsecond table shows each epoch of insertion along with the offset of International Atomic Time (TAI) with respect to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), as disseminated by NTP. The table can be obtained directly from NIST national time servers using <tt>ftp</tt> as the ASCII file <tt>pub/leap-seconds</tt>.</p>
        <p>While not strictly a security function, the Autokey protocol provides means to securely retrieve the leapsecond table from a server or peer. Servers load the leapsecond table directly from the file specified in the <tt>crypto</tt> command, with default <tt>ntpkey_leap</tt>, while clients can obtain the table indirectly from the servers using the Autokey protocol. Once loaded, the table can be provided on request to other clients and servers.</p>
        <h4 id="#fmt">File Formats</h4>
        <p>The file formats begin with two lines. The first contains the file name, including the generated hostname and filestamp. The second contains the datestamp in conventional Unix <tt>date</tt> format. Lines beginning with <tt>#</tt> are considered comments and ignored by the daemon. In the <tt>ntp.keys</tt> file, the next 16 lines contain the MD5 keys. If necessary, this file can be further customized using an ordinary text editor. The format is described below. For all other files the cryptographic values are encoded first using ASN.1 encoding rules and then in PEM-encoded printable ASCII format preceded and followed by MIME content identifier lines.</p>
        <p>Private/public key files and certificates are compatible with other OpenSSL applications and very likely other libraries as well. Certificates or certificate requests derived from them should be compatible with extant industry practice, although some users might find the interpretation of X509v3 extension fields somewhat liberal. However, the identification parameter files, although encoded as the other files, are probably not compatible with anything other than Autokey.</p>
        <p>The format of the symmetric keys file is somewhat different than the other files in the interest of backward compatibility. Since DES-CBC is deprecated in NTPv4, the only key format of interest is MD5 alphanumeric strings. Keys are entered one per line in the format</p>
        <p><i><tt>keyno type key</tt></i></p>
        <p>where <i><tt>keyno</tt></i> is a positive integer in the range 1-65,535, <i><tt>type</tt></i> is the string <tt>MD5</tt> defining the key format and <i><tt>key</tt></i> is the key itself, which is a printable ASCII string 16 characters or less in length. Each character is chosen from the 93 printable characters in the range 0x21 through 0x7f excluding space and the '#' character.</p>
        <p>Note that the keys used by the <tt>ntpq</tt> and <tt>ntpdc</tt> programs are checked against passwords requested by the programs and entered by hand, so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys in human readable ASCII format.</p>
        <h4 id="#bug">Bugs</h4>
        <p>It can take quite a while to generate some cryptographic values, from one to several minutes with modern architectures such as UltraSPARC and up tens of minutes to an hour with older architectures such as SPARC IPC.</p>
