Focus: enhancements and bug fixes.

Dynamic interface rescanning was added to simplify the use of ntpd in 
conjunction with DHCP. GNU AutoGen is used for its command-line options 
processing. Separate PPS devices are supported for PARSE refclocks, MD5 
signatures are now provided for the release files. Drivers have been 
added for some new ref-clocks and have been removed for some older 
ref-clocks. This release also includes other improvements, documentation 
and bug fixes. 

K&R C is no longer supported as of NTP-4.2.4. We are now aiming for ANSI 
C support.
