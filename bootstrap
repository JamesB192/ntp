#  This "bootstrap" script performs various pre-autoreconf actions
#  that are required after pulling fresh sources from the repository.
#
#  NOTE:  THE NTP VERSION NUMBER COMES FROM packageinfo.sh
#
#  all other instances of it anywhere in the source base have propagated
#  from this one source.
#
#  To use the raw sources from the repository, you must have the following
#  tools available to you:
#
#  1.  Autoconf and Automake.
#
#  2.  AutoGen.  The repository does *not* contain the files generated from
#      the option definition files and it does not contain the libopts
#      tear-off/redistributable library.
#
#  3.  gunzip.  The tear-off library is a gzipped tarball.
#
#  4.  lynx.  This is used to extract the COPYRIGHT file extracted from
#      the html documentation.
#
#  5.  bash, ksh, zsh or any POSIX compliant shell to run this script.
