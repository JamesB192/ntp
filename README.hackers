Dave likes this code indented formatted in a consistent way.
The file "dot.emacs" has the emacs C-mode indentation style that Dave likes.

NTP4 uses ANSI C.  Some folks are blessed with a pre-ansi C compiler.  We
support them by using "ansi2knr" in the Makefiles, which is automatically
detected and selected by the configure process.

For ansi2knr to work, we MUST define functions as follows:

type stuff
function_name ( actual parameters )

While the whitespace is optional, the function name MUST start at column 0.

---

We'd like to see *all* system function declarations live in include/l_stdlib.h
and NEVER appear in the .c files.

If you are going to patch both ntp-stable and ntp-dev
please do it this way:

 > cd ntp-stable
 > (make and test your changes to ntp-stable first)
 > (commit your changes to ntp-stable)
 > cd ../ntp-dev
 > bk pull ../ntp-stable	(get your changes from ntp-stable)
 > (resolve any problems and test your changes)
 > (commit your changes to ntp-dev)

With the current release of bitkeeper it is *much* easier to move changes
from ntp-stable to ntp-dev than it is to move changes from ntp-dev to
ntp-stable.

If you make your changes in the above order and then submit them,
it will be trivial to apply your patches.

Otherwise, it will be much more difficult to apply your patches.

---

Please read (and follow) the previous section if you want to submit
patches for both ntp-stable and ntp-dev.

To submit patches please use the 'bk send' command:

 > cd REPO
 > bk citool	(or bk ci ... ;  bk commit ... )
 > bk pull	# make sure your repo is up-to-date
 > bk send -d -ubk://www.ntp.org/home/bk/REPO YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS
		# This will send you the patches
		# If you have a mailer that wraps lines or otherwise
		# changes the body of the message, add '-wuu'
 # save this email to a file
 > bk receive -vv -a < mail-file-containing-the-patch
		# Sanity check.
 > bk send -d -ubk://www.ntp.org/home/bk/REPO bugs@ntp.org
		# If you needed to add '-wuu' then add it here, too.
		# this command sends the patch to the NTP project.
