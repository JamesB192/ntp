If you get NTP via CVS, you will need to build the release using GNU make
and gcc.

You can then "make dist" to build a release tarball that does not require
GNU make or gcc.

The reason GNU make and gcc are required is because the repository version
of NTP does not have the make dependencies built-in.  These dependencies
are created dynamically, and this dynamic process requires GNU make and gcc.
